        <h1>THE GIT RAP</h1>
		<p>yo, this is the git rap
			we gonna do it like this
			we gonna do it like that
			i got ten stacks pushed in my stash
			git stash clear, it was gone like that
			but have no fear cause i bounce right back
			some use a gui, and i guess thats fine 
			but your boy right here prefers the command line
		</p>
		<p>
			git init to git the party started
			git add them files and then we git retarded
			got got no no no idea what what what is in store
			just a touch that file dot-git-ignore
		
			(dont forget .DS_Store in your gitignore)
			(dont forget .DS_Store in your gitignore)
			thats only if you got mac
		</p>
		<p>
			so, now we taking the tour
			got files added, don't need no more
			yo this is too legit to quit
			so its time for the git commit
			i do a dash-a to specify them all
			dash -m with the message that ima show yall
			this is the first commit and we standing tall
			git push origin master you dont wanna brawl
		</p>
		<p>	( why? )

			chillin in my dash-b boy stance
			git check it out yo to make a new branch
			top of the mountain pushing down code like an avalanche
			SVN and CVS never hard a chance
			its undisputed its distributed 
			all the boys and girls agree the github
			ocotcat is the cutest 
			im a github boss title unrefuted
